# Derivative

This crate provides a set of alternative `#[derive]` attributes for Rust.

## Stability

This crate is not stable yet and the attributes might change at any time.

For now the crate only works on nightly but it uses *rustc*'s Macros 1.1 and is
meant to be usable on stable as soon as it is possible.
